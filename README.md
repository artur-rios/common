# Common

A library with utilities to be shared with .Net projects.
I work on it in my free time, so if you want to contribute, please feel free to do so.
Developed this as a way to share code between different projects, as a submodule. Everything is divided into projects so you can reference only what you need on your solution.
I also like to get creative here, so I test a lot of ideas and patterns. Expect some experimental features and overengineering.

## Can I use it in real projects?

Everything here is tested by me in by using the features in other projects. And the idea is having everything 100% covered by unit tests. We're not there yet, but it's a goal.
So, yes, you can use it in real projects. But please, be aware that some features are experimental and may change in the future. I recommend to analyze the code before using it and if needed, feel free to open an issue, a pull request or fork it.
